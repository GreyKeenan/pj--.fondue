removed png_interpret -> dechunk
	I'm dumb. The chunking process described is what creates the final chunks, like IHDR etc
	I thought it meant the IDAT was also split into chunks internally somehow.

added PNG_ReferenceImage struct
	to store the output of getReferenceImage (renamed)
	not 'true' reference image described in PNG standard, since may be indexed still

PNG_read
	_isCapitalized -> _isLowercase
		checks 5th bit (32) as per PNG specification

error checks in PNG_read
	checks for multiple IDAT chunks. panics if true. Add later: just concatenate them together? potentially a lot of memory.
