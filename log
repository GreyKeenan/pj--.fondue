filled out README

created makefile
created main.c

grabbed utils/err, originally from pj.sublime.c

utils/endian
	check endian-ness of system
	flip endian-ness of sequence of bytes

	used to work with PNG standard's big-endianness

utils/png
	(may move to utils/files/png)

	code for interpreting pngs, regardless of use case
		(use case is fondue for this repo)

	identify PNG by header
	read chunk's headers
	read IHDR chunk
	grab data from IDAT chunk (dont process yet)
	
	uses utils/endian
	uses utils/err

main.c
	fondue's main c file

	uses utils/png

	2 parts:
		cli tool to create custom font files
			starting with png -> font file conversion
		way to use those font files in tandem with displaying graphics, like SDL2
			created for use with pj.sublime.c


General:
	point of this was I didnt want to use SDL_TTF because adding more libraries is annoying
	I could have tried to write a TTF file decoder instead, but I wanted to make my own for fun
	Now, am trying to understand PNG format so can decode it properly to create my font from a png.
		a bit of a diversion since I could just make a dumb txt/char interpreter or something but idk understanding pngs is interesting

		plus, understanding pngs may make it easier to use them with SDL w/o SDL_Image if I want
