* I read up on zlib, DEFLATE, huffman coding, and lz77. See GreyKeenan/le.DEFLATE

	after doing so, I dont think that this fondue sub-project is really necessary at all. a custom font-file would just be less effective than using a PNG, plus the font should be packed together in a sprite sheet with other images.
		I dont really need a separate tool to encode them somehow, because now that I know how PNG encoding works, I can achieve what I would have wanted, if not more, just through an image editor & image-magick
	the decoding-for-the-sake-of-rendering-with-SDL part is still needed, but that doesn't need to be in its own repo.
	it will be modular, but if other independent utilities and stuff are just included within pj.sublime.c anyways, this one should be too
	
	plan to update master w/ this info (not that it really matters) and move to ar.fondue

	

	I will still be reusing/reworking some of the PNG-decoding code from this repo in pj.sublime.c
